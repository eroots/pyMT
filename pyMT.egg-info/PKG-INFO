pyMT
====

Codebase for visualization, analysis, and preparation of magnetotelluric data for inversion (compatible with ModEM, MT3DANI, and WSINV3DMT)

Installation basics (tested method for new users)

1) Install anaconda (or miniconda; skip this if you already have anaconda)

2) Open anaconda prompt

3) Create an environment for pyMT, re-load a few dependencies::

	conda create -n pymt python conda pip git setuptools

4) Enter that environment::

	conda activate pymt

5) Add that command to your .bashrc (or whatever login script) so you don't have to enter it every time you open a new anaconda prompt

6) Install pyMT::
	
	pip install git+https://github.com/eroots/pyMT.git

7) Any time you want to update to the latest version, use::

	pip install --upgrade  git+https://github.com/eroots/pyMT.git

8) Navigate to wherever your working folder (typically the highest folder containing your MT data and workflow) is and launch::

	gateway_mt

Note: The dependence on natural-neighbor has been removed to improve the installation process. The default interpolation method for plan-view pseudosections is now based on the linear kernel of the scipy radial basis function interpolator (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.RBFInterpolator.html).

If you prefer the natural neighbor interpolation, an updated version (compatible with the latest versions of python and numpy) can be installed via::

	pip install git+https://github.com/eroots/natural-neighbor-interpolation

Note that the natural-neighbor package requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables. These may already be installed, but on newer PCs you may have to first install Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)

Getting Started:

All of the GUIs (data_plot, mesh_designer, model_viewer) can now be accessed through one main window, which is launched using the command::

		gateway_mt

This GUI is essentially just a table containing all the files needed for a series of datasets (where a dataset is any permutation of a list file, and inversion data/response/model files). 

Double click a cell to manually type paths to relevant files, or highlight a data set (a row in the table) and click 'Browse' to select files. You may select multiple files and the program will attempt to sort them into the correct locations.

Once files have been added, highlight a data set and click the 'Data Plot', 'Mesh Designer', or 'Model Viewer' buttons to launch the relevant GUI with the highlighted dataset. The Data Plot GUI is capable of loading multiple data sets at once so you can easily compare data and/or models from different inversions.
